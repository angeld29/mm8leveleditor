      <title>Java Requirements</title>
    <p>This tool requires Java Runtime (JRE) 1.4.2 or greater. You may already have this installed. From a
    command prompt type "java -version", and if the result is "java 1.4" or higher, you
    should be set.</p>
    <p>Currently this can be retrieved at the following URL if you do not already have it
    installed.</p>
    <p>The full development environment is available at <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html.</a></p>
    <p>Supposedly, just the basic java runtime can be retrieved at <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">http://java.sun.com/getjava/</a></p>

      <title>Running</title>
    <p>Once java is installed, you should be able to launch this program with "java -jar
    mm8leveleditor.jar", or if you're using windows, you can probably just double-click
    on the mm8leveleditor.jar file.</p>
    <p>Technical note: The jar file itself contains the classpath information needed so
    that it knows to look for unlod-base.jar and jmf.jar (only used for wav file support)
    in the same folder as mm8leveleditor.jar. If you choose to run this using an
    alternative method, note that all three jar files (mm8leveleditor.jar,
    unlod-base.jar, jmf.jar) need to be in your classpath, and the Class to execute is
    "org.gamenet.application.mm8leveleditor.MM8LevelEditor"</p>

      <title>Memory Requirements</title>
    <p>You might need to grant java more memory (java defaults to 64Mb total) for large data
    resources.   Use "java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar mm8leveleditor.jar" to do this.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Preferences</title>
    <p>The preferences for this application are stored in a file called
    "MM8LevelEditor.properties" which will probably be created in your current working
    directory. Some future change may make the location of this file easier to deal with.
    For now, you should try to keep your working directory in the same place as your jar
    files. If MM8LevelEditor is unable to find this file, it will create a new one.</p>
