    <p>Please feel free to contact me for any assistance, or if you'd like to help out
    with this project.</p>
    <p>If you contact me, please specify "mm8leveleditor" in the email subject and please
    use plain-text (not html) email. Otherwise your message is very likely to be detected
    as spam. It's always possible it might end up getting caught in the spam filter
    anyway, so if you don't hear from me within a few days, you may want to try
    again.</p>
    <p>I'm always looking for assistance on this project. There's web pages that need to
    be designed, documentation that needs to be written, testing that needs to be done,
    and setting up the various administrative functions on sourceforge (mailing lists,
    bug tracker, etc) as well as general programming on the project itself.</p>
    <p>You can also file bugs and requests of enhancements using the sourceforge tracker system.</p>
