    <faq id="Java">
      <question>
            What version of Java does this require?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
            Java 1.4.2 or higher.   You only need the JRE and not the JDK.  I test everything using Sun Java 1.4.2.

    <faq id="OutOfMemoryException">
      <question>
            Why am I getting an OutOfMemoryException or heap space allocation error?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
            You might need to grant java more memory (java defaults to 64Mb total)
            for large data resources.   Use
            "<code>java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M -jar mm8leveleditor.jar</code>"
            to set the available memory to 1024Mb.
