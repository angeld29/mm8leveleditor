Need to put readme file in zip distribution package.

Needed Improvements
- DSft.bin needs mm7 and mm8 support
- dlv format isn't correct for all mm6 dlv files
- Handle offsets in blv Unknown0 data
- Items in chest control array
- duplicate/add lod resources
- create decoding table tool and handler
- decode identified status bits - 0/1 id, 0/2 broken, 0/4?
- decode unknown1 chest contents
- handle special magic in chest items, gold in items
- decode unknown3 in chest items (item class?)
- Dirty status for handler data changes
- lodresourcecontroller instance tracker (especially for dirty data)
- Add new/changed palette support for importing sprites.
- Remove sprite loading lookup table objects and read array directly
- Pal handler imports
- Bin file handlers
- Cross-reference data in other files
- Raw file imports
--MM7 and MM8 level format differences
- Some events have different formats
- Odm/blv/ddm/dlv have slightly different formats

Useful Enhancements
- Retrieve save panel from application controller for persistence
- Multiple monitor panel (a la eclipse background tasks)
- Refactor UnlodFrame into display and control classes
- Convert docs to xdoc format so I don't maintain two files for README and index.html.
- Provide separate getData for raw/decoded composite data
- Have icon palettes as part of getData/writeData
- Load in multiple-image formats.
- Write file converter functions for importing/exporting/displaying fnt files
- Write tests that compute the md5 signature for all extracted MM6-8 resources to insure the basic unpacking code is still valid.
- Find a better way to locate MM8LevelEditor.properties?
- Somehow find installation directory for MM6-8 and make the default path point to one of them?
- Create handler mechanism so LodFileLoader can be versioned and no longer referenced in org.gamenet.
- Create loader mechanism for loading various LOD file types rather than hardcoding them in LodFileLoader
