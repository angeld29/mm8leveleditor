Not every item for a chest shows up if the item placement fails.
Intentional? or bug?

MM6
=====
Sewer Key bug -- sewer key sometimes doesn't appear in Freehaven sewer if you exit before finding it
You can have two henchmen with the same name, and dismissing one doesn't always do what you want.

MM7
=====
lich jar bug (opening chest with the Souljars under Thunderfist Mountain makes them disappear)

MM8
=====
Can't sell special items

Xanthor bug
ssence is in fact, that Conflux Key appearance in your inventory is triggered by two circumstances:
1. Clicking on hostel door in Ravenshore
2. Presence of all 4 Elemental Keys in your inventory.
the third - presence of Xanthor in hostel - is skipped. Get the Hearts, click on empty hostel door, see the movie and - voila!- go into Crystal.

Opening dungeon door in turn-based mode fails to allow character join dialogs
